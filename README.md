This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## This is the React part of the challenge from here (https://github.com/elsahib/node-challenge-chat-server)

## Challenge: Advanced: Add a React app as a front-end

Note: only do this if you have done all other Node homework this week - including Levels 1-3 of this challenge. The priority during the node module is _node_!

- [ ] Make a very simple React app called chat-react-app

Note: Do not use `create-react-app` if you want your React code to be code-reviewed! Instead, you should:

- [ ] fork our starting repo. See "How should I start my React app", below.

#### Your UI should at least:

- [ ] Display the latest messages on load
- [ ] Provide a "see latest" button to fetch and display the latest messages
- [ ] Provide a "delete" button or a clickable icon next to each message.
  - [ ] When clicked this should delete the message from the server and then from the local display.

#### Optionally, your UI may also:

- [ ] Load and re-display the latest messages every 30 seconds.
- [ ] Allow the user to use as much as possible of the back-end that you developed in levels 1-4 (e.g. message search).

#### Don't forget:

- [ ] You'll have to enable CORS on the express app (see note below)
  - For how to post JSON, Read ["Using Fetch", on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)
- [ ] Host your react app on netlify
- [ ] Attach the link in your google classroom submission (along with your glitch server url)

#### How should I start my React app?

To make code review easier for us, please:

- [ ] fork our starting repo. (You can later create a PR when you want a code review.)

The repo is here: https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/cyf-chat-react

- [ ] Follow the "Making a Pull Request" guide on https://codeyourfuture.github.io/syllabus-master/others/making-a-pull-request.html

- [ ] Then run `npm install` after opening a terminal in the new project directory.

- Note that this repo was made by simply running `create-react-app` exactly as you have done in the past. There is nothing special about it!
